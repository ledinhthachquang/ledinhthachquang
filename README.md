## How to install

### The easy way


### The slightly-less-easy-but-still-totally-doable way

Check to see if you have Ruby installed (`ruby -v`). If you don't, you can follow the installation instructions provided [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Next you'll have to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (a simple `gem install bundler jekyll` should suffice).

```sh

```

You'll also need some additional dependencies:

```sh

```

## How to use


```sh

```


```sh

```


### Automating the build & upload with rsync

## Customize

### Basics

First thing you want to do is edit a couple of things in `/_config.yml`:

- `title`: The title of your photo stream
- `email`: Your email address (this line is optional, you can remove it)
- `author`
    - `name`: Your name
    - `email`: Your email address (optional)
    - `website`: Your website (could be the address of this photo stream)
- `description`: Description of your photo stream
- `baseurl`: Should be `""` **⚠️ Do not change unless you know what you're doing**
- `url`: Where will this photo stream live (example: `https://maxvoltar.photo`)
- `twitter_username`: Your Twitter username
- `github_username`: Your Github username
- `instagram_username`: Your Instagram username

Don't include the `@`-part of your social handles. By default links to your Github and Instagram profiles are hidden. You can uncomment these by going into `/index.html`. There, you can also add links to wherever you want. Just add more `<li>`'s with `class="link"` to the `<ul class="links">` list.

### Advanced

Before publishing your website, Jekyll will resize your photos into 3 different buckets:

- `/photos/large`: These are only shown when a user navigates to a photo page. By default these are resized to a maximum of 2048 wide and 2048 tall. If you wish, you can change these by changing the values in `/_config.yml` (by default they look something like this: `resize_to_limit: [2048, 2048]`).
- `/photos/thumbnail`: These are used in the grid. Photo Stream will load all thumbnails above the fold, then more as you scroll down; all to save bandwidth. Standard size for these is 640 by 640 (max), but you can also change this if needed.
- `/photos/tint`: What you see while the page loads its first batch of thumbnails, also used as the background for photo pages. **⚠️ Do not make changes to the tint versions in your config file.**
